Solar Power Forecasting
Solar irradiation is one of the major renewable energy sources and technologies related with this source have reached to high level
applications. Prediction of solar irradiation shows some uncertainties depending on atmospheric parameters such as temperature, cloud
amount, dust and relative humidity. These conditions add new uncertainties to the prediction of this astronomical parameter. In this
case, prediction of generated electricity by photovoltaic or other solar technologies could be better than directly solar irradiation.
sensor networks (WSNs). Environmentally-powered systems,
however, have to deal with the variable behavior of ambient
energy sources, which results in different amounts and rates
of energy available over time. To alleviate the problem of the
harvested power being neither constant nor continuous, energy
prediction methods can be employed. Such models forecast the
source availability and estimate the expected energy intake,
allowing the system to take critical decisions about the utiliza-
tion of the available energy. In this work, we present a novel
