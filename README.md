# UG-PROJECT : Solar Power Forecasting
Solar irradiation is one of the major renewable energy sources and technologies related with this source have reached to high level
applications. Prediction of solar irradiation shows some uncertainties depending on atmospheric parameters such as temperature, cloud
amount, dust and relative humidity. These conditions add new uncertainties to the prediction of this astronomical parameter. In this
case, prediction of generated electricity by photovoltaic or other solar technologies could be better than directly solar irradiation.
sensor networks (WSNs). Environmentally-powered systems,
however, have to deal with the variable behavior of ambient
energy sources, which results in different amounts and rates
of energy available over time. To alleviate the problem of the
harvested power being neither constant nor continuous, energy
prediction methods can be employed. Such models forecast the
source availability and estimate the expected energy intake,
allowing the system to take critical decisions about the utiliza-
tion of the available energy. In this work, we present a novel

## Dataset:
Most of our work is done on the suny_international dataset.It contains the following columns<br>
'DHI', 'DNI', 'GHI', 'Clearsky DHI', 'Clearsky DNI', 'Clearsky GHI',
       'Cloud Type', 'Dew Point', 'Temperature', 'Pressure',
       'Relative Humidity', 'Solar Zenith Angle', 'Precipitable Water',
       'Wind Direction', 'Wind Speed', 'Fill Flag'<br>
The readings are available at the interval of 30 min with most of the radiation being concentrated between 06:00 and 18:00.


## Analysis:
Before we begin with the prediction and modelling, we need to first analyze the data which we have obtained. The following graphic shows the variation of the daily GHI per day.
